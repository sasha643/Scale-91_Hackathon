# Deepfake Detection using Face Recognition and Neural Networks

## Introduction

This repository implements a deepfake detection system using face recognition techniques and neural networks. The system processes videos, extracts frames, detects faces, and employs a pre-trained neural network for classification.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install the required libraries and packages before running the code:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow face_recognition torch torchvision tqdm matplotlib seaborn
```
